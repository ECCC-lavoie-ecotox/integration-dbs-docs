To build this documentation locally, follow these steps.

# Prerequisites

Install the two R libraries using the following commands:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

# Install package database interface
devtools::install_github("ECCC-lavoie-ecotox/toxbox")

# Install documentation 
install.packages("quarto")
```

## Get documentation source code

Steve - I will give a training on how to clone a git repository and push new edits to the documentation. In the meatime, if you're already set to work with git and Rstudio, the repository URL is avaible at [https://github.com/ECCC-lavoie-ecotox/integration-dbs-docs](https://github.com/ECCC-lavoie-ecotox/integration-dbs-docs).

## Build this website

```r
# Serve the website in your browser
quarto::quarto_preview()
```

This approach allows you to work on the documentation files in parallel. Each time a file is modified, the website is rebuilt to include the latest changes.
